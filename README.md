Hello!
This is a template of the menu I made with A-Frame.
It's free to use and edit it, I am also still working on it in my free time.

This menu is based on the Sword Art Online Animanga menu.
To edit and learn how it works I recommend learning A-Frame with their documentation (https://aframe.io/).

I hope you all enjoy the template and do wonderous things with it.

Kind regards, Ignithia.
